--Forking and cloning--

Have a git account, with an SSH key for the node you are working on.

While logged in to your git account, from here:
   https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie
click the Fork button and follow instructions to fork into your own repository.

From within your own forked repository, click the Clone or Download / SSH button to find the address of the repository, e.g. in my case:

   git@github.com:mulhearn/artie.git

Now from your node, you would do (e.g. in my case):

> git clone git@github.com:mulhearn/artie.git

We'll be staying current with the original repository of Jingbo, so you should also 

> git remote add upstream https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie.git
> git remote -v

You'll see origin (your fork) and upstream (main repository of Jingbo)

--Compilation on DUNE GPVM (13 and higher)--

> source ./setup/dunegpvm.csh
> make 
> ./bin/Linux-g++/Artie run_short.mac 

--Keeping up to date and making a PR--

For simplicity, let's assume you will do your own work on branch master, and have committed your most recent changes via:

git commit -m "my awesome changes"

And you would like to make a PR to make your changes available for everyone.

First make sure you are upto date with upstream:

> git fetch upstream
> git merge upstream/master

If no one else is working, you will see "Already up to date."  If not,
don't panic, this is totally normal, and really the whole purpose for
git, so just resolve conflicts as needed (See:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/addressing-merge-conflicts)

Repeat as needed until you get "Already up to date."

Now update your own repository directly with:

> git push origin master

I like to make a specific PR-branch, so I can press on with my work as usual on master while the PR is being handled, so I also do:

> git push origin master:pr-ADD-SHORT-DESCRIPTION

when I am ready to make a PR.  To make the PR, on the github website, switch to this branch in your repository, and click the New Pull Request button.  Add a description and submit!
